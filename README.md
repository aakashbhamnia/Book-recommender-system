# Movie Recommender System

A movie recommendation system that provides personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences and ratings using machine learning algorithms.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests movies based on a user's previous ratings or genre preferences.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies that are liked by similar users.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggests movies based on features like genre, director, or actors.
- **Interactive Interface**: Allows users to input their preferences and get movie recommendations instantly.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **Scikit-learn** (for building recommendation models)
- **Flask** (for building the backend API)
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (for the frontend interface)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for data analysis and model development)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aakashbhamnia/Book-recommender-system.git
   cd Movie-recommender-system
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open the app in your browser by navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Movie data is gathered from sources such as [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) or [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/).
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The collected data is cleaned and structured, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
3. **Modeling**: Collaborative filtering and content-based filtering models are trained using movie ratings and attributes (e.g., genre, director, actors).
4. **Recommendation Engine**: Based on user input (genre preferences, ratings), the system suggests the most relevant movies.

## Example Usage

- **Input**: "Recommend movies similar to 'Inception' or 'The Dark Knight'."
- **Output**: A list of recommended movies based on content similarities and user preferences.
